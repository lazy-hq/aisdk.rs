title: Tools
---

A 'Tool' is a general term for a function or logic that can be executed by an AI
model. They can be user defined or pre-defined by the provider. Tools are provided
to the AI model's context as per the developer's needs.The AI model can then use the
provided tools to perform specific queries to aid in text generation or actions to
be taken externally. Most common tools include the following searching the web,
querying a public API, executing a shell command, and more.

Here is the recommended and less verbose way to define a tool. It allows you to annotate native
Rust functions with the `#[tool]` macro, which will generate the `Tool` struct for you.

```rust
use crate::core::{tool, Tool};

#[tool]
/// Get the weather information given a location
pub fn get_weather(location: String) {
    let weather = match location.as_str() {
        // Some logic to query a weather API
        "New York" => 75,
        "Tokyo" => 80,
        _ => 70,
    };
    Ok(weather.to_string())
}
```
The macro will infer the following fields from the function:

- **name**: 
- **description**: The function's doc comment. you can use rust style documentation with examples for few-shot prompting.
- **input_schema**: The schema of the function's input(argument) type. remember that whatever you define as
arguements should implement the `schemars::JsonSchema` trait or be natively supported by the `schemars` crate.
- **execute**: The function itself. The body will be executed when the AI model calls the tool.

A tool has 4 components:

- **name**: It is used to identify the tool in the AI model. Make sure it is unique and describes
what the tool does well. The name of the tool in this case is `get_weather`.

- **description**: This is a brief description of what the tool does. It is used to
help the AI model understand what the tool does and how to use it. The function's doc comment 
as the description. you can use rust style documentation with examples for few-shot prompting

- **arguments**: This is the schema of the input that the AI model will use to generate
inputs for the tool. It uses the [schemars](https://docs.rs/schemars/latest/schemars/) crate
to define the [json schema](https://json-schema.org/) of the input. The function's arguments
are serialized into json schema in which the AI model will use to generate inputs. 
just make sure
the arguments implement the `schemars::JsonSchema` trait or are natively supported
by the `schemars` crate.

- **body**: This is the logic that will be called when the AI model calls the tool. it 
takes a single argument of type `serde_json::Value` which is the json input provided by the AI model. the function should return a `Result<String, String>`
which is the output of the tool. If the tool fails, you can return an error message as `Err(String)` which can
also be helpful for the AI model to understand what went wrong.

## Using the structs

You can define your own tools in aisdk by instantiating the `Tool` and related structs and passing
it to one of the AI model text generation builders.

```rust
let func = ToolExecute::new(Box::new(|inp: Value| {
    Ok(format!("hello {}", inp.get("recipient").unwrap()))
}));

#[derive(schemars::JsonSchema, Debug)]
struct ToolInput {
    recipient: String,
}

let schema = schemars::schema_for!(ToolInput);

let my_tool = Tool::builder()
    .name("my-tool") // this is the name in which the Ai will use to call the tool
    .description("my-description") // describes what the tool does, helpful for the Ai
    .input_schema(schema.clone()) // the schema of the input. Ai will use this to generate inputs
    .execute(func) // the function that will be called when the Ai calls the tool
    .build()
    .unwrap();
```

## Registering the tool

To register the tool with the AI model, you need to add it to text generation builders using the `with_tool` method. This
appends the tool to the list of tools that the AI model will use to generate text.

```rust
let result = LanguageModelRequest::builder()
    .model(OpenAI::new("gpt-4o"))
    .system("You are a helpful assistant with access to tools.")
    .prompt("What is the weather in New York?")
    .with_tool(get_weather)
    .build()
    .generate_text()
    .await?;
```
