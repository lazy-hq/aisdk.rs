title: Basic Usage
---

The AI SDK standardizes integrating artificial intelligence (AI) models across [supported providers](/docs/#model-providers). This enables developers to focus on building great AI applications, not waste time on technical details.

For example, here’s how you can generate text with various models using the AI SDK

### Enable the [Provider](/docs/#model-providers) of your choice

You can enable the provider you want by using the feature flag of the provider. e.g. for [OpenAI](/docs/providers)

```bash
cargo add aisdk --features openai # anthropic, google or any other provider
```

### Generating Text

To generate text, you can use the `LanguageModelRequest` builder and call the `generate_text()` method. This method returns a `GenerateTextResponse` which contains the generated text and other information such as token usage statistics, stop reason, and tool call results

you can find more info about generating text [here](/docs/concepts/language-model-request#generate_text).

<CustomCodeTabs tabsData={[
	{
		value: "openai",
		label: "OpenAI",
		icon: "OpenAI",
		code: "OpenAIGenerateText",
	},
	{
		value: "anthropic",
		label: "Anthropic",
		icon: "Anthropic",
		code: "AnthropicGenerateText",
	},
	{
		value: "google",
		label: "Google",
		icon: "Google",
		code: "GoogleGenerateText",
	},
]} />

### Streaming Text

To stream text, you can use the `LanguageModelRequest` builder and call the `stream_text()` method. This method returns a `StreamTextResponse` which contains the generated text and other information such as token usage statistics, stop reason, and tool call results.

You can find more info about streaming text [here](/docs/concepts/language-model-request#stream_text).

<CustomCodeTabs tabsData={[
	{
		value: "openai",
		label: "OpenAI",
		icon: "OpenAI",
		code: "OpenAIStreamText",
	},
	{
		value: "anthropic",
		label: "Anthropic",
		icon: "Anthropic",
		code: "AnthropicStreamText",
	},
	{
		value: "google",
		label: "Google",
		icon: "Google",
		code: "GoogleStreamText",
	},
]} />
